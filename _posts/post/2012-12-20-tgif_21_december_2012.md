The whole "regular Friday post" thing got away from me, so here is my second weekly post in almost two months. On the plus side I've been extremely busy.


## [swxben.dataaccess](https://github.com/swxben/swxben.dataaccess)

I moved my data access layer out into [its own GitHub repository](https://github.com/swxben/swxben.dataaccess) and started distributing it [via NuGet](http://nuget.org/packages/swxben.dataaccess). Since then I’ve added some features – an attribute to indicate that fields and properties in DTOs should be ignored in update and insert operation, and support for DTOs that don't have a parameterless constructor.


## [DocXTemplateEngine](https://github.com/swxben/docx-template-engine)

I created a really basic [template engine](https://github.com/swxben/docx-template-engine) that takes an MS Word document and replaces merge fields with values. Since then it has even had a couple of contributions from [@deltasem](https://github.com/deltasem) which is really cool. It is also [available on NuGet](http://nuget.org/packages/swxben.docxtemplateengine).


## [swxben.reporting](https://github.com/swxben/swxben.reporting)

I started a [reporting library](https://github.com/swxben/swxben.reporting) that converts XML (generated from Razor templates in the examples although they could be generated using other methods) into HTML, CSV and PDF. It has a [NuGet package](http://nuget.org/packages/swxben.reporting) and there is also a package that [provides an example Razor template](http://nuget.org/packages/swxben.reporting.razor).

As part of this I submitted a [quick patch](http://razorgenerator.codeplex.com/workitem/91) to the [RazorGenerator](http://razorgenerator.codeplex.com/) project, which was accepted and released on NuGet overnight. I <3 OSS.
