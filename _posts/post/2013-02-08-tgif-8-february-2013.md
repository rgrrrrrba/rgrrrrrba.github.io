I've been brutally busy over the holidays and since then. A lot of the client work I have done has included a number of improvements and additions to SWXBEN's OSS swag.


## [swxben.dataaccess](https://github.com/swxben/swxben.dataaccess/)

I've added a number of features to my little data access layer:

- decorating identifier fields, which is used when generating `UPDATE` and `INSERT` statements
	- `int` identifiers are skipped in `INSERT` statements
- insert operations returns `SELECT @@IDENTITY` so you can do `foo.FooId = (int)dataAccess.Insert(foo);`
- table names can be explicitly passed in to `Update`, `Select` and `Insert`


## [swxben.reporting](https://github.com/swxben/swxben.reporting)

- started on some documentation on the [XRPT format](https://github.com/swxben/swxben.reporting/blob/master/xrpt.md)
- added a `System.Web` drop-in replacement so Razor features such as `Html.Raw()` work without requiring `System.Web` (which makes client deploys needlessly complex). This isn’t included in the `swxben.reporting` core, but as a [separate NuGet package](http://nuget.org/packages/swxben.reporting.System.Web).


## [swxben.helpers](https://github.com/swxben/swxben.helpers)

Pulled out a small suite of extension methods, some based on Ruby, some on PHP madness, some just shoddy implementations of things that I need to frequently do such as sentence casing a `"PascalCasedString"` or formatting decimals. This was mostly for my own benefit rather than something I thought would be useful as OSS, but it's managed a few downloads [on NuGet](http://nuget.org/packages/swxben.helpers).


## [swxben.Windows.Forms](https://github.com/swxben/swxben.Windows.Forms)

A small collection of WinForms dialogs and helpers. List search dialogs are pretty cool. [Available on NuGet](http://nuget.org/packages/swxben.Windows.Forms).


## [Slab](https://github.com/swxben/slab)

I’m resurrecting my PHP MVC-ish framework Slab – hitting it with a lightning bolt if you will (ah I'm so funny) – in response to an upcoming project that will use it. PHP may not be the sexiest of environments but it is still pretty ubiquitous and simple to set up a shared host, so it is nice to be able to work with a relatively stable home-brewed framework.
