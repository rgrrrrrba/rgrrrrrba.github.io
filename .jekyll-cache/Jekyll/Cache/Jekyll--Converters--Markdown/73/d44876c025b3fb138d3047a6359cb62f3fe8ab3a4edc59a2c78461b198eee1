I"U<p>I’m trying to push a very large (for me) repository to <a href="https://bitbucket.org">BitBucket</a>. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.hg</code> folder is 2.5 G which is a pretty big chunk. This is my first time using BitBucket, in fact until now my experience of hosting Mercurial repos has been limited to either file shares or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hg serve</code>, so initially I tried pushing over HTTP.</p>

<p>Four hours later and no real data had been sent, so I did some looking and decided to try using SSH. It seems to be working well at the moment (still sending as I type) but I’m not going to attempt writing my own tutorial so here are some links I found useful:</p>
