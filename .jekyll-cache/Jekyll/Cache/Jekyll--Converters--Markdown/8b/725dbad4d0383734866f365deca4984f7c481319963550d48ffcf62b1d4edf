I"¥<p>I accidently blew away my databases (while upgrading the SQL Server version) and my local Azure Service Bus stopped working. You canâ€™t reinstall or restore easily AFAIK so I just wanted to uninstall Azure Service Bus and start again. Unfortunately you canâ€™t uninstall without leaving the farm, and you canâ€™t leave the farm without the databases.</p>

<p>The answer is to remove the registry key for the service bus, which is in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Service Bus</code>. That tells the unstaller that there is nothing to see and allows uninstallation.</p>
