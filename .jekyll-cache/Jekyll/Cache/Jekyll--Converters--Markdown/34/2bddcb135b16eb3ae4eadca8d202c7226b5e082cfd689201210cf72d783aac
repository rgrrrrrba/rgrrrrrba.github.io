I"<p>I heard about the phrase â€œtoxic positivityâ€ recently, I think on a podcast about mental health I was listening to. It put a name to something Iâ€™ve experienced for a long time.</p>

<p>As I <a href="/about-me">mention</a> I live with often severe depression. My friends and family know this, as do many of my colleagues. However, a lot of the time when I am in a low mood, and Iâ€™m particularly vulnerable or tempted to be open about how Iâ€™m feeling, Iâ€™m worried about peopleâ€™s reactions. Not because theyâ€™ll think that Iâ€™m losing it, necessarily, or that theyâ€™ll tell me to talk to my doctor or dismiss me out of hand.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m worried that theyâ€™ll tell me something positive.</p>

<p>That I need to look on the bright side.</p>

<p>That I need to practice being happy, and grateful for what I have.</p>

<p>That Iâ€™ve come so far. Look how far youâ€™ve come! Youâ€™re doing so well.</p>

<p>What they donâ€™t understand is that this makes the pain so much worse. I <em>know</em> how far Iâ€™ve come. I <em>know</em> how lucky I am, to live in a house, with relatively good physical health, with a child who loves me. They just donâ€™t realise that at those moments when Iâ€™m especially low, I <em>donâ€™t care</em> about how lucky I am. They donâ€™t realise that when Iâ€™m being told to be positive, it <em>hurts</em> me, physically.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s like a spear being pushed into my stomach. Why canâ€™t I be happy? Whatâ€™s wrong with me? Why isnâ€™t it as simple as they make out? It hurts. It dismisses everything Iâ€™m going through. I <em>know</em> that itâ€™s all in my head. What they donâ€™t realise is that it is <em>physically</em> in my head. Depression is caused my imbalances in hormone levels, particularly dopamine and serotonin. This isnâ€™t something I can <em>think</em> my way out of.</p>

<p>When Iâ€™m being told these things, it completely invalidates my experience. It dismisses my feelings of depression by saying that I just need to not be feeling depressed.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m not a child, and you wouldnâ€™t tell a child these things either. You would take them to a doctor or a psychologist and figure out what is actually wrong. You wouldnâ€™t do what appears to be brushing off my painful experience.</p>

<p>â€œYou donâ€™t <em>look</em> depressed.â€ Friend, let me tell you about masking. Iâ€™m putting an enormous amount of energy in appearing â€œnormalâ€ to you, and as soon as I am out of this situation Iâ€™ll probably collapse in a heap.</p>

<p>For people who experience depression, being functional is <em>work</em>, and many people get to a point where there just isnâ€™t any energy left to put into that work.</p>

<p>And they start looking for ways out.</p>

<p>Please donâ€™t tell me to be grateful, to change my thoughts, to look on the bright side.</p>

<p>I already know how blessed and privileged I am. When Iâ€™m in the middle of a depressive episode, I simply donâ€™t care.</p>
