I"<<p>Using a PR / peer review model when developing in a team is a great way keep quality high with a large number of changes. This model relies on being able to review diffs easily, something which Bitbucket is usually pretty good at.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Bitbucket falls down once PRs reach a certain size:</p>

<p>Ideally, PRs should be small enough that this doesn’t crop up, but when you’re performing large refactors or working on significant feature branches the ideal isn’t always possible.</p>

<p>TortoiseGit to the rescue: <a href="https://wikgren.fi/compare-diff-branches-in-tortoise-git-or-how-to-preview-changes-before-doing-a-merge/">Compare (Diff) branches in Tortoise Git, or how to preview changes before doing a merge</a>.</p>

<p>Basically:</p>

  <li>Select <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TortoiseGit -&gt; Browse Reference</code></li>
  <li>Select the two branches to compare using control (usually the current branch and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code>)</li>
