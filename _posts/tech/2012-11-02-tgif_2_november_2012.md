TGIF is going to be (an attempt at) a weekly wrap-up of what has happened in the world of SWXBEN, such as the odd OSS contribution, tech news, or something picked up during development.


## Twitter Bootstrap

I'm using Twitter Bootstrap as a basis for a couple of web-based LOB applications that are in development. This is a fantastic framework that speeds up development times considerably and version 2.2.1 just came out. Quick tip, I needed a date picker, I found a [really easy date picker designed for Twitter Bootstrap](https://github.com/eternicode/bootstrap-datepicker) and it is a thing of beauty. The markup looks like this:

	<div class="input-append date" id="received_date" data-date="2012-10-31" data-date-format="yyyy-mm-dd"> <input class="input-medium" type="date" name="ReceivedDate" value="2012-10-31")" readonly /> <span class="add-on"><i class="icon-th"></i></span> </div> 

It is then initialised like so:

	$('#received_date').datepicker({ autoclose: true }); 


## Nancy

I'm also using the [Nancy framework](http://nancyfx.org/) for back-end development. This framework is originally inspired by the Ruby-based framework Sinatra, but runs on Windows-based servers. Very cool stuff, especially with Razor templating.


## OSS data access layer

I developed and [announced](/2012-10-31-super_simple_data_access_laayer.html) an OSS data access layer, which is a single file MS SQL abstraction layer inspired by the likes of [Massive](https://github.com/robconery/massive). Since the initial development I've added cool stuff like built-in INSERTs, UPDATEs and SELECTs. [Check it out](https://github.com/swxben/Shu-Er/blob/master/dotnet/DataAccess/src/Swxben.DataAccess/DataAccess.cs) as part of the [Shu-er](https://github.com/swxben/Shu-Er) collection of scripts and tidbits.


## Office 365

Last weekend I moved [Capricorn Investment Partners](http://www.capinvest.com.au/) from a self-hosted Exchange 2003 server over to Office 365, which is basically Exchange, Sharepoint and Lync hosted in the cloud. Some tips:

- Export each user's PST using Outlook on their desktop. If you try to use Exchange's `ExMerge` utility it will silently hit a limit at around 2 GB, resulting in a corrupted export. Exporting the PST on the desktop gets around that limit.
- When you import the PST back up into the cloud, you'll quickly flood the outbound connection. 10 years of operation resulted in a total mailbox size of around 70 GB and that takes some time to upload on an ADSL 2+ connection. Be prepared to write off your weekend – at least.
- Kill the old Exchange services before setting up the new account, and create the new account in a new profile, otherwise the old domain settings will mess with the new configuration.

Big thanks to [Clint from Centre State Computer Maintenance](http://www.cscm.com.au/) and [Petros from Ultimate IT](http://www.ultimateit.com.au/) for their help and tips during the setup.
