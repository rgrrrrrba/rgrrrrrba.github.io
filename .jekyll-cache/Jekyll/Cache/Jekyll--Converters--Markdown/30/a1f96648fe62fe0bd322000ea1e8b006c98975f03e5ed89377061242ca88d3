I"´<p>Iâ€™m using <a href="https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/">Apache FOP</a> to generate PDFs from <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xsl">XSL:FO</a>, and an external graphic (think the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;img&gt;</code> tag in HTML) kept being resized incorrectly. Another image (different size) was the correct size on the page. Turns out I was using height and width attributes in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fo:external-graphic</code> element, when I should have been using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">content-height</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">content-width</code>. Somehow the second image respected the height and width I wanted. Possibly this has something to do with the stored DPI of the images (since XSL:FO is a specification for printed documents), but in any case content-width and content-height is the way to go.</p>
