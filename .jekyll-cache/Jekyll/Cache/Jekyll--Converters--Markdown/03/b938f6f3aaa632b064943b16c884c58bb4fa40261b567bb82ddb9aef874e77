I"ë<p>Is a very annoying error message that you get when writing above average complexity <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SELECT</code> statements. Iâ€™m not sure if it only applies to queries against SQL Server, but it can be very difficult to debug if you havenâ€™t come across it before (or come across so many things in a day that they all blur into one big problem).</p>

<p>For me at least it happens like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Bec writes a big meaty query, tests it, all ok</li>
  <li>Bec writes query #2, which has the same SELECTed columns as the first query, tests also, also ok</li>
  <li>Bec sticks a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UNION ALL</code> between the two queries, thus making Das Uberqueryâ„¢ and securing his employment</li>
  <li>Bec executes said query and gets cryptic error message, spends rest of day tring to debug 300 lines of SQL, goes home with migraine.</li>
</ol>

<p>It sounds like one of the queries has an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ORDER BY</code> clause but of course Iâ€™ve taken all of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ORDER BY</code>s out when joining them, and Iâ€™m ordering the UNION as a whole!</p>

<p>The issue is that one or more of the big mutha queries that are being UNION ALLed together contain a subquery that contains a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ORDER BY</code> clause. Something like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>SELECT t1.A, t2.B
FROM t1, (SELECT TOP 1 * FROM Foo ORDER BY Bar) t2
UNION ALL
SELECT t3.A, t3.B
FROM t3
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Itâ€™s that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ORDER BY Bar</code> part that gives grief. I canâ€™t see why itâ€™s an issue, but this is what to look out for. Replace the subquery with a view or find some other way to do it without the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ORDER BY</code> clause.</p>
