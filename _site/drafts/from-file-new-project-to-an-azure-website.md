# From File -> New Project to an Azure Website

I'll assume that you've got an Azure subscription already set up. *so it isn't really file -> new project ... *

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](http://manage.windowsazure.com) 
2. Navigate to WEB APPS
3. Click the + in the footer
4. Select COMPUTE -> WEB APP -> QUICK CREATE
5. Enter a name for the site - the final URL will be `name.azurewebsites.net`
