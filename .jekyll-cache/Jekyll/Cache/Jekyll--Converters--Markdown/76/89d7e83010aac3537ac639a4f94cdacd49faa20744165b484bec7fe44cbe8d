I"5<p>I needed a quick way to clone a repository without any network access. There is probably an easy, safe way of making a bundle to clone from but for now I just copied a live <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.hg</code> folder into the destination folder and ran <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hg revert --all</code>. Seems to be relatively stable. Copying the whole repository would have worked as well and wouldnâ€™t require setting up the working copy, but would have taken much longer to compress, copy and decompress.</p>
