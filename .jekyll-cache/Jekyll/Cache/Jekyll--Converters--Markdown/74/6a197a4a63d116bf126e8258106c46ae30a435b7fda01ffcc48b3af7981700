I"¬<p><strong>You need to do this because you have line of business software or printer/scanner/faxes that need to send emails within a corporate intranet and your email server is hosted offsite.</strong></p>

<p>This doesnâ€™t work with Office 365 acting as the external SMTP server. It should work but thereâ€™s something about Office 365â€™s use of TLS that stops the SMTP relay from authenticating properly in hMailServer. The same problem seems to happen with IISâ€™s built-in SMTP relay so I think I may have been doing something wrong. In any case, although the main <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.com.au</code>â€™s MX is Office 365, I also have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.net.au</code> domain hosted on a shared server with a more straightforward (ie less secure) configuration, which I used as the relay.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Install <a href="https://www.hmailserver.com/">hMailServer</a> on a Windows machine within the intranet. Make sure port 25 isnâ€™t blocked by a firewall on the machine. The default self-hosted SQL Server Compact database option in hMailServer should be fine.</li>
  <li>Create an email address on the external mail server. Something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">relay@example.com</code>.</li>
  <li>Create a wildcard route on hMailServer.
    <ul>
      <li>This is a domain of *.</li>
      <li>The target SMTP host should be set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mail.example.com</code> or wherever the external server is hosted.</li>
      <li>The TCP/IP port should be set to 25.</li>
      <li>Under the Delivery tab check the <em>Server requires authentication</em> box and fill in the user name and password for the relay email address.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The trick is that hMailServer doesnâ€™t seem to support wildcard routes, even though it will let you create a route of *. To work around this you just add a rule that sends everything to the wildcard route:
    <ol>
      <li>Name the rule <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wildcard</code></li>
      <li>Add a criteria: predefined field <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">From</code>, search type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Wildcard</code>, value is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*</code></li>
      <li>Add an action: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Send using route to *</code></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Under <em>Advanced</em>, <em>IP Ranges</em>, add a range called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">intranet</code> or similar:
    <ol>
      <li>Set the lower and upper IP ranges to encompass your intranet (eg <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">192.168.1.0</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">192.168.1.255</code>)</li>
      <li>Set the priority to something greater than 15</li>
      <li>Under <em>Other</em>, uncheck <em>Anti-spam</em>, <em>Anti-virus</em></li>
      <li>Under <em>Require SMTP authentication</em>, uncheck all of the boxes</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Save everything</li>
</ol>

<p>This can be tested by telnetting (or <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTy</a>ing) into port 25 of the machine, then sending an email by hand (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol#SMTP_transport_example">Wikipediaâ€™s entry for SMTP</a> for an example). Sending the email by hand is a very easy way to figure out configuration problems on the client-facing side of the SMTP relay and is a skill worth learning - also it makes you look like a boss if anybody nearby understands what you are doing. The email should be sent through the hMailServer SMTP relay, through to the external SMTP server (using the relay email address for authentication), then through to its destination. hMailServer also has pretty good logging which can help figure out any bugs or misconfiguration.</p>
