I"N<p>Finding out what ports are open on a machine is something I often need to do, and I usually stuff around for ages trying to figure out whether a particular port is open. The fastest way I’ve (just) found is by opening a console and running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">netstat -a</code>, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">netstat -an</code> to show IP and port numbers rather than machine and service names.</p>

<p>Now that I know that the port’s definitely open, I’ve just got to figure out why the service still isn’t working…</p>
