I'm an aspiring hardware hacker, so I've got boxes and trays of electrical components like capacitors and Arduinos laying around everywhere. This can make it hard to find what I need sometimes. Rather than making a spreadsheet to help track where things go, I of course used the opportunity to start hacking together my own parts management tool.

This is both an experiment in lean engineering (I'm using [LiteDb](https://www.litedb.org/) and [Lucene.net](https://lucenenet.apache.org/) in the backend) and in learning Blazor more fully.
