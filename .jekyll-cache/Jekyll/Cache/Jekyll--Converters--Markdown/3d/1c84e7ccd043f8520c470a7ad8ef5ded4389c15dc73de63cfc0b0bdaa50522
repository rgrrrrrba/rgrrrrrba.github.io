I"¯<p>Iâ€™m writing a generic class that inherits from a base class, implements an interface, and has a type constraint on the generic class. The class inheritance and interface are straightforward, as is the type constraint, but combined together itâ€™s not obvious how to write this. Any examples of type constraints I could find donâ€™t have inheritance or interfaces as well. So, via a bit of trail and error, here is a right way to declare such a class:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>public class MyClass&lt;T&gt; :
    BaseClass&lt;T&gt;, IMyInterface
    where T : ClassOfT
{...}
</code></pre></div></div>
