<p>Iâ€™m an aspiring hardware hacker, so Iâ€™ve got boxes and trays of electrical components like capacitors and Arduinos laying around everywhere. This can make it hard to find what I need sometimes. Rather than making a spreadsheet to help track where things go, I of course used the opportunity to start hacking together my own parts management tool.</p>

<p>This is both an experiment in lean engineering (Iâ€™m using <a href="https://www.litedb.org/">LiteDb</a> and <a href="https://lucenenet.apache.org/">Lucene.net</a> in the backend) and in learning Blazor more fully.</p>
