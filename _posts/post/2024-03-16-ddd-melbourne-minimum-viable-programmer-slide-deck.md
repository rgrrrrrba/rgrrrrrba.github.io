I spoke at DDD Melbourne today. This was the very first time I have done a conference talk, and (with the help of some tactical Valium) I think it went pretty well.

I was asked a couple of times about sharing my slide deck, so [here it is](/images/ddd-melb-2024-mvp.pdf). This is a PDF version that doesn't include my speaker notes.

This was a 20 minute talk and I'll be expanding it out into a longer form talk for [presenting to clients, internally, and anyone other interested companies through SixPivot](https://www.sixpivot.com.au/speakers/rebecca-scott).

I'll also be converting it into a blog post, which should come out in the next week or so.
