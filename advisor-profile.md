As an accomplished technology leader with extensive experience in various leadership positions, I offer expertise in software development, project planning, and team guidance. With a background as a CTO and Head of Technology in multiple startups, I have honed my skills in bootstrapping software projects and overseeing their successful execution. My passion for fostering inclusive environments has led me to actively engage in initiatives focused on neurodiversity and mental health, while also serving as a mentor to aspiring professionals in the field. As a leader in various companies I have brought a wealth of strategic thinking and planning.

## Experience
