Last night I had the pleasure of (remotely) presenting my [Minimal Viable Programmer](./minimum-viable-programmer) talk at [Tech Leading Ladies](https://techleadingladies.com/), a community group for women identifying and non-binary people working in software development and technology.

Thanks to everyone who came along, and huge thanks to everyone who contributed to the conversation afterwards. I'm not a very experienced presenter but I felt quite at home with the group. I'm definitely looking forward to participating in the group and joining in to future meetups.

As promised, [here are my slides from the talk](./images/mvp-tech-leading-ladies-oct-2024.pptx).

If you are interested in having me present this talk at your community group or company, please [get in touch](./contact).
