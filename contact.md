# [~/](/)Contact me

I've bailed on Twitter (the account is active but it is no longer a part of my life). So the best ways to contact me are:

- Email:
    - Personal: <me@becdetat.com>
    - Work: <rebecca.scott@sixpivot.com.au> (remembering the impermanence of things such as jobs)
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebecca-scott-b522a418/)
- If you happen to be on the Brisbane Developer's Slack, I'm @becdetat (you might have already noticed me, I can be noisy sometimes...)

I also have a [GitHub](https://github.com/becdetat). I don't know why or how you could contact me on GitHub. But it's there. Maybe you'll find something interesting and ask me about it? We can have a talk? A little tête-à-tête? Grab a chai latte? Submit a bug report?
