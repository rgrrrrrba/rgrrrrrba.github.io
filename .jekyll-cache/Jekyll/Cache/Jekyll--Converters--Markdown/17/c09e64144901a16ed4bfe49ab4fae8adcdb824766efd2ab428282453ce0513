<p>Iâ€™ve bailed on Twitter (the account is active but it is no longer a part of my life). So the best ways to contact me are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Email:
    <ul>
      <li>Personal: <a href="mailto:me@becdetat.com">me@becdetat.com</a></li>
      <li>Work: <a href="mailto:rebecca.scott@sixpivot.com.au">rebecca.scott@sixpivot.com.au</a> (remembering the impermanence of things such as jobs)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebecca-scott-b522a418/">LinkedIn</a></li>
  <li>If you happen to be on the Brisbane Developerâ€™s Slack, Iâ€™m @becdetat (you might have already noticed me, I can be noisy sometimesâ€¦)</li>
</ul>

<p>I also have a <a href="https://github.com/becdetat">GitHub</a>. I donâ€™t know why or how you could contact me on GitHub. But itâ€™s there. Maybe youâ€™ll find something interesting and ask me about it? We can have a talk? A little tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte? Grab a chai latte? Submit a bug report?</p>
